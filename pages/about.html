        More importantly, I'm a loving daughter, devoted wife and proud mother to two beautiful girls.
Oh, and I almost forgot, I'm probably the only Wilton Certified cake artist in Pune! (Humble Brag)
In 2020, I returned to my beloved India after more than a decade abroad & was unable to find authentic cheesecakes anywhere in Pune - so I started crafting them myself!
And the rest is history...
Come hang out with me on Instagram. I love interacting with fellow cheesecake lovers!
